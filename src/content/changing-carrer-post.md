# ðŸš€ From Retirement Fund Management to Web Development: My Career Transition

For several years, I worked in the retirement fund sector, assisting professionals like dentists and midwives with their financial security. While this role honed my ability to listen, work under deadlines, and collaborate in a team, I felt a growing need for a more creative and technically stimulating career.

## ðŸ’¡ Why Web Development?

Technology has always intrigued me, and my time at 42 introduced me to coding. There, I developed strong problem-solving skills through C programming and algorithmic challenges. However, I wanted a structured path to becoming a professional developer, leading me to explore various training programs before choosing DonkeySchool.

## ðŸ”¥ Embracing the Change

Switching careers wasn't easy, but my passion for web development kept me motivated. Iâ€™ve since gained experience in **Node.js, Symfony, and TypeScript**, actively participating in meetups like **Paris TypeScript, React, and Vue.js** to stay connected with the developer community.

## ðŸŽ¯ Whatâ€™s Next?

My goal is to create innovative and user-friendly applications while continuously improving my skills. Web development offers the challenge and variety I was looking for, and Iâ€™m excited about what the future holds.
